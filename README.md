### Features

- Built In / Custom Categories
- Daily expenses graphs
- Monthly expenses Trends
- Select any range
- Category Aggregates / Breakdowns
- End-of-month Forecasts
- Debit Sum / Count Overviews
- [Powerful search](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch) for Dataset table
- [Locally Stored](https://tinybase.org/) (Browser Storage / IndexedDB)
- Import Transactions as CSV
- Import/Export all data as SQLite DB

### Why?

- Because I didn't want to open my budget tracker app and manually add transactions everytime
- Zero work (after categorizing)
- One, authoritative source of truth (it's literally your bank)

### Your Data

This is a **fully client-side React app**... the only network request is for fetching currency rates.

All your data is stored in your Browser's [IndexedDB](https://tinybase.org/api/persister-indexed-db/interfaces/persister/indexeddbpersister/) Storage. You can inspect everything the app sees by clicking the tiny black-and-pink icon on the bottom.

You can conveniently **export** or **restore** the entire database from the settings tab.
